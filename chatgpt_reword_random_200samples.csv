Living as an immigrant in a developed country means inhabiting two parallel worlds. In urbanized communities, one may encounter alternative perspectives, developing fresh ideas and heightened self-assurance.

The title of the film, Sudani From Nigeria, serves as a subtle yet powerful reminder of our divided and complex identities. The story takes place in an African country ravaged by civil war, where football is seen as the only glimmer of hope for restless young people. While some succeed, many are left behind. The African community has been an integral part of Indian football, with players like Chima Okorie leaving their mark. For the past 20 years, African students and youngsters have driven the popular sevens soccer culture in Kerala, yet it's amazing that it's taken this long for us to understand their experiences as football refugees."

The SABC is dishonest, fraudulent, and unreliable. It would be wise to shut it down and allocate the billions and millions of Rands to impoverishment the poor.

In my opinion, implementing a living wage could be a solution to distributing the benefits of globalization more equitably.

Modern capitalism fails to recognize the importance of unity due to its neglect of the communal aspect of the economy, entrepreneurship, relationships, and patents. Conversely, perhaps society is unaware of the significance of unity because it fails to witness its presence in the fight for underprivileged rights, such as those living in destitute areas, unemployed laborers, immigrants, and impoverished individuals living under the shadow of society. Alternatively, society may misunderstand unions because corruption has seeped into the core of union leadership. We cannot allow such misperceptions to hinder progress."

Providing free school meals helps support the most underprivileged students.

The thieves stole a meager loaf, retribution fell on the hungry and broke. The arrogant land grabber stole the earth and all it held within. The first group had no hope of escaping the law's conviction, but the latter used deception to elude consequences. Fairness was needed, as even the poor called for compassion. The vicious commenced an unholy war but stayed far from the dangerous front lines. Instead, they pushed the sons of the destitute to the front, where they fought and suffered while raising funds for liberty. Those who declared war should have gone first, accepting the brunt of the battle's ferocity if they were loyal to their nation and its citizens. This expectation of equality would have put an end to deadly ammunition. The oppressed poor united, preventing the exploitation of Pakistan's rulers."
