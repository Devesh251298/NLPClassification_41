The expert:

**Presupposition:**
""" These poor ladies are definitely going through some traumatic issues right now , and I am asking that they come forward so that I help them ? together with women parliamentarians - to be able to heal ."""
	- This sentence has a condescending tone and to a woman, it sounds like this sentence is implying that women tend to have "more" traumatic issues or they are more vulnerable. But to a man, this sentence might sound normal. I would expect two annotators to mark this as PCL but in fact only one annotator did, which again shows that it could be very subjective to determine if this is PCL. 


"""It is written in Ecclessiastes in the Bible that ' WOE TO ANY NATION WHERE A SLAVE BECOMES KING ' This typifies the situation in Nigeria since the inception of that country . I weep for my country when I visited home in 2009 and toured my alma mater- ABSU ... the infrastructural decay reduced me to tears . No matter how much OIL is sold in the world market the money will not change the corrupt/ sorry situation in Nigeria . The only thing that will change it is REVOLUTION . I weep for the children , pregnant women , the sick , infirms and the vulnerables who are trapped in this diabolical hole called Nigeria . My advice to Nigerians ... ' GOD WILL NOT DO FOR MAN WHAT MAN CAN DO FOR HIMSELF ' Wake and take your destinies in your hands stop calling on God for simple things you can do , learn from Egypt , Tunisia and Libya experience ."""
	- The annotator flagged "No matter how much OIL is sold in the world market the money will not change the corrupt/ sorry situation in Nigeria" and "This typifies the situation in Nigeria since the inception of that country" as PCL language, but if we read the entire text, it's clear that the author is from Nigeria but appears to not live in Nigeria anymore, therefore, we could argue that the author is from a privileged community, however, they might actually know what they are talking about considering they are from Nigeria. 


**Authority voice:**
"""People do n't understand the hurt , people do n't understand the pain . I 've read about women with their children sleeping in cars , sleeping in hotel rooms and it 's criminal . If they 're lucky and they come across COPE Galway and the ladies in Osterley , then there 's hope . """
	- I'd agree that this fits the description for "authority voice" 

"""Real poverty of Britain : Shocking images of UK in the Sixties where poor really meant poor <h> THESE hard-hitting photographs offer a glimpse into the harrowing day-to-day for poor families living in Britain during the Sixties ."""
This sounds like an objective description of the images and the sixties in Britain. The author is not "standing themselves as a spokesperson of the group, or ex-plains or advises the members of a community about the community itself or a specific situation they are living. "
