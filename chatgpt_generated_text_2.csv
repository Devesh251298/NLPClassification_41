""The people in the city rush by, their faces etched with worry and fear.

And though they may not know it, they inspire poetry.""",1
"

""Oh ye, simple folk of the countryside,
Whose daily toil bears fruit of the land,
Your rugged faces weathered by the sun,
With sinews strong from manual labor's hand.

Yet still, amidst the drudgery of your task,
A beauty lingers, a simple grace,
That whispers of a life both rich and stark,
Forged by nature's hand, in time and space.

Oh, how I envy thee, for in thy journey,
You've found a peace that I can only dream,
A happiness that's teased but ne'er fully won,
In this modern life, with its endless scheme.

So as I write these lines, with pen in hand,
I humbly bow to thee, old-fashioned clan,
And pray that some of your enduring spirit,
Might guide me to a life more truly grand.""",1
"

Here's an example:

Oh, you wretched, lost souls  
Drifting aimlessly through life  
Unable to find your footing  
In a world full of strife  

But fear not, my dear ones  
For though your path may be dark  
There is beauty in your struggle  
And grace in each shattered heart  

Your pain is not in vain  
For it will teach you to be strong  
And the scars that you bear  
Are a testament to all you've overcome  

So hold your heads up high  
And embrace the unknown  
For in your deepest struggles  
Your greatest strengths are shown.",1
"

""The poor man's humble abode, though small and worn,
Holds treasures of love, that cannot be bought or sold.
Through hardship and toil, his spirit remains bold
And his kind heart, a shining beacon to behold.

Oh, how we could learn from his simple way of life
And cherish the things that truly matter, without strife.
Let us not forget the struggles he endures each day
And lend a helping hand, in every possible way.""",1
"

""Their minds are but flowers, delicate and rare,
Sprouting amidst the chaos and despair.
Though life may seem cruel, it is in this bloom,
That we find hope and a reason to exhume."" 

This is an example of a poet speaking in a patronizing manner, using flowery language and metaphors to describe a community or group of people (in this case, those who are struggling). The focus is on the 'they,' as the poet describes their situation and uses language to either elevate or console them.",1
"

In the midst of urban sprawl,
Amidst the concrete and the pall,
I see a hidden beauty.

The tattered buildings worn with age,
Bear witness to a bygone age,
A moment in history.

The people here may struggle to survive,
But still, they find a way to thrive,
To persevere, to keep hope alive.

Yes, there is grittiness and pain,
But amidst it all, there's something to gain,
Lessons to be learned and stories to be told.

So let us not turn a blind eye,
Let us not dismiss, let us not deny,
The beauty in the struggle, the strength in the fight.",1
"

Example:

The poet sees a homeless person on the street and says:

""Behold the wretched wanderer, cast aside by fate and circumstance, yet still he bears the burden with stoic grace. Though he may lack in riches and comfort, he possesses a wealth of inner strength that the most privileged could only envy. Through his struggle, we are reminded of the fragility and impermanence of our own lives, and we are humbled by his enduring spirit. Let us learn from his example, and strive to be more kind and compassionate to those who suffer in this world.""",1
"

""In the bleakness of winter's grip,
The trees stand bare and stripped,
Yet their nakedness reveals a truth,
That beneath the surface lies strength and youth.

The howling winds may cause chills,
But do not underestimate the will,
Of those who brave the biting cold,
For they have stories that must be told.

Though the sky may seem forever gray,
Hope shines through in its own way,
For even in the darkest night,
Stars still gleam with a steadfast light.

So let us not despair, but rather find,
The beauty in each struggle and bind,
For in the end, it's not the pain we feel,
But the lessons we learn that make life real.""",1
"

""The village dweller toils under the scorching sun, yet finds solace in the sweet melody of birdsong. They embrace the simplicity of their life, as they nurture the land and their fellow kind with empathy and care. Oh, how we could all learn from their steadfast spirit and unyielding devotion to nature.""",1
"

:

""The windswept streets, abandoned and cold,
Seemly barren, yet a story untold.
For in these very stones and alleys,
Lies the history of life's travails and follies.

The graffiti on the walls, a rebel's voice,
A cry for freedom, a desperate choice.
The broken glass, shards of shattered dreams,
The littered remains of forgotten schemes.

But amidst this chaos and decay,
A beauty lingers, in its own way.
For in the resilience of these streets,
We find a spirit that refuses defeat.

So let us not overlook the grit and grace,
Of the forgotten souls in this difficult place.
For in their struggles, we find our own,
And in their stories, we find our home.""",1
"

:

""The simple folk, with dirt beneath their nails,  
Yet their hearts are pure like the morning dew.  
Their struggles, though they seem insurmountable,  
Are but opportunities for growth anew.  
For in their hardships, they find strength untold,  
And amidst their toil, their courage does unfold.  
So let us learn from their resolute spirit,

And cherish the lessons they so kindly impart.""",1
"

""As I gaze upon the bustling masses, trudging through the city streets,
Their weary faces etched with lines of toil and strife,
I cannot help but marvel at their resilience,
Their ability to weather storms and find new life.

Their ceaseless struggles, their everyday strife,
Are all but mere mere droplets in an ocean of time,
And yet they persist, against all odds,
Unfazed by the trials that their path does unbind.

Oh, how wondrous is the human spirit,
That shines so bright in the darkest of days,
And lifts us up, towards the heavens,
With hope and faith in better ways.

So let us honor the unsung heroes,
Whose courage shines like a beacon in the night,
And celebrate the beauty of life's journey,
With all its ups and downs, its twists and its might.""",1
"

:

""The weary farmer toils the land,
With sweat upon his brow and calloused hands,
Yet in the rhythm of his work,
A symphony of beauty can be heard.

For in his labour, he brings forth life,
As crops rise from the fertile earth,
And in his toil, he embodies strength,
That we may learn from his noble worth.

So let us not overlook this labour,
But praise the farmer's tireless strife,
For in his work, we find a treasure,
That nourishes our very life.""",1
"

""O, ye mortals, lost in the maze of life,
Hearken to my words, and end thy strife.
For though the path be steep and full of thorns,
'Tis but a journey to thy soul's reborn.

The trials and tribulations that thou face,
Are but stepping stones to a higher place.
Embrace the struggle, and thou shalt see,
The beauty in thy adversity.

For like a rose that blooms in the rain,
Thy spirit shall flourish, free from pain.
And though the storm may rage and roar,
Thou shalt emerge, stronger than before.""",1
"

""Behold the humble farmer, toiling under the scorching sun,
His calloused hands and weary brow bear witness to the work done.
Though sweat stains his shirt and dust clings to his shoes,
His spirit remains steadfast, his dedication never to lose.

For he tills the land with purpose and care,
Nurturing each seed with hope and prayer.

They're blind to the wonders that nature provides.
But fear not, my dear friends, for I am here,
To open your eyes, to make the magic appear.

Unable to see the light that shines within,
Lost in darkness, refusing to begin.

A way to break through the barriers of mind,
To touch the soul and stir the heart to see
The beauty that surrounds us endlessly.""",1

Here is an example of what a poet might say:

Oh, they who walk the streets at night,
With weary eyes and burdened hearts,
How they bear the weight of life's great fight,
And yet, their spirit never departs.

From shadows cast by flickering light,
To broken dreams and shattered hopes,
They trudge along with all their might,
And climb the hill of life's steep slopes.

Their stories told in whispers low,
Of love, of loss, of joy, of woe,
Each step they take a weary blow,
Yet, still they rise, and onward go.

Oh, they who walk the streets at night,
With tears and scars, and souls that shine,
May their journey lead them to the light,
And may their courage never decline.",1
"

An example of what the poet might say:

Behold the humble sparrow, with wings so small and frail,
Yet see how bravely it takes flight, despite the fierce gale.
Amid the storm it flits and floats, a tiny, feathered gem,
Teaching us that even in adversity, we too can triumph.",1
"

""Behold the wretched streets, where poverty doth reign,
Yet even in this dark abyss, a beauty doth remain.

And strive to create a world of true equality.""",1

And never give up, never quit

With hearts open, and souls so pure

To live a life that's rich and sure""",1

A beauty lingers in each moment's passing.  
For every hardship is a chance at life,  
And each obstacle but a lesson everlasting.  

So let us not condemn their daily grind,

""Behold the city streets, with their mighty roar,
Where hustle and bustle reign supreme galore!

For every person with a dream to pursue,
This city offers numerous opportunities anew.

Navigate through the challenges of this bustling space.
The cacophony of our daily lives blends in,
To create a symphony of hopes, dreams, and wins.""",1

In the quiet corners of the alleyways,
The workers toil tirelessly,
To ensure another day.

What we do not understand,
For within the city's heartbeats,
Lies a world so grand.""",1
"

""O, tiny town, with cobbled streets and crooked lanes,
Where the sun dips low upon autumn's golden plains,
Your humble homes, though worn and weathered,
Are a testament to the strength of your endeavor.

For in every crack and crevice, there blooms a flower,
And each winding way holds secrets of great power.
For though you may seem small and insignificant,
Your spirit is as fierce as a lion's bellowing belligerent.

So do not underestimate this quaint abode,
For within its walls, stories are waiting to be told.
Of strength, courage, and unyielding will,
That are as timeless as the hills and rivers still.""

In this example, the poet uses beautiful and descriptive language to depict a small town that may seem unremarkable, but is actually full of hidden strength and beauty.

And their work is a sacred call.

And in their toil, our nation stands.""",1

That beauty can be found in all things,
If only we spread our wings.

And be inspired to make a choice,
To live our lives with love and grace,
And leave our mark, a lasting trace.",1

Through sun and storm, through bleakest night and day.
For in their heart, a flame of courage burns,
A flame that never fades, come what may.

To those who brave the trials of this life.

Tending the land, it's secrets he keeps

The beauty of creation, the gift of the land 
A song of gratitude, let it fill our hearts and stand.""",1
