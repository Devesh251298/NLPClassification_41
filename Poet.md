Poet

The poet. The focus is not on the we (author and audience), but on the they (the individual or community referred to). The author uses a literary style to describe people or situations. They might, for example, use (or abuse) adjectives or rhetorical devices to either present a difficult situation as somehow beautiful, something to admire and learn from, or they might carefully detail its roughness to touch the heart of their audience. The subcategories we establish are:

– Metaphor. 

– Compassion. 

''Bond went out of his way to help the less fortunate , often going on the road with Kim to take food to the homeless''
This can be a particularly difficult to classify under Compassion because the compassion is not displayed towards the main object of the sentence unlike a sentence like " People don't understand the hurt , people do n't understand the pain . I 've read about women with their children sleeping in cars , sleeping in hotel rooms and it 's criminal . If they 're lucky and they come across COPE Galway and the ladies in Osterley , then there 's hope." where compassion is directed towards main subject.

''You know the type . She 's excelling in her field while tutoring underprivileged kids , running 5K fundraisers and adopting the most hopeless rescue dogs as pets -- and she's not afraid to gloat about it .'' In this sentence there are two sources of compassion, "underprivileged kids" and "hopeless rescue dogs". The former is a general way of saying something about a kid with lack of resources so not sure if this should be counted as patronizing. The later part is a bit tricky in the sense that do we classify non human beings in a category that are affected by this kind of language.




– The poorer, the merrier.
