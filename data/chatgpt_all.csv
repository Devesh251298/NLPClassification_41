Example: ""Behold the peasants toiling in the fields,
with sunburnt skin and calloused hands,
yet their spirits remain unyielding,
strong and resilient as the land they tend.

Their faces creased with wrinkles,
telltale signs of a life well-lived,
of hardship and sacrifice,
yet their eyes gleam with a fierce joy,
for they know the value of their labor,
the magic of the earth,
the harvest that feeds us all.

So let us honor these unsung heroes,
these keepers of the soil,
for they are the backbone of our society,
the guardians of our sustenance,
the poets of the land.""",1
"

""If only they could see through the veil of their ignorance,
And realize the beauty that lies within their own souls.
For in each of them, there exists a unique brilliance,
A spark of divinity that ignites and controls.
But alas, they remain blind to their own magnificence,
Lost in the dark abyss of self-doubt and fear.
Oh, if only they could hear the whispers of transcendence,
And let go of all that holds them back, drawing near.""",1
"

An example of what the poet would say:

""Look at how the beggars line the street,
Their tattered clothes and worn out feet.
Observe the way they carry on,
In spite of all that they have gone through.

See how each one fights to live
With dignity and grace they give
Their hearts to each and every day,
In ways that we can't truly say.

Oh, let us learn from their brave souls,
And empathize with their goal to be whole.
For in their struggles lies a lesson,
To cherish life and count our blessings.""",1
"

Example: ""Oh, ye lazy souls, how thy slothful habits burden thee! Your languid bodies and idle minds, a shame to human dignity. Yet, in the depths of thy indolence, a spark of potential lies, waiting to be kindled by the flame of perseverance and drive. Rise up, ye sluggards, and embrace the noble path of productivity!""",1
"

""The common folk toil and sweat,  
Their hands rough with earth and grit.  
Yet they smile and carry on,  
As if life were a sweet song.  

Their struggles I may never know,  
But their strength I cannot help but show.  
For in their simple lives I see,  
A beauty that's truly inspiring.""",1
"

Example: 

The poet speaks in a patronizing tone as they describe a group of people working hard in the fields:

""Look at the farmers toiling away,
With hands calloused and bent backs they sway.
Their wrinkled faces show the struggle,
But oh how beautiful is their humble juggle.""

Here, the poet uses flowery language and portrays the hard working farmers as something to admire, even though their daily grind is often rough and exhausting. The poet attempts to create a romanticized image of the farmers' plight to evoke empathy and emotion from the audience.",1
"

""Look at the way they toil in the fields,
Their backbreaking labor never yields.
But behold the way they endure,
Their spirits unbroken, pure and sure.

The sun beats down upon their skin,
The sweat and toil, a constant din.
Yet they persevere with heads held high,
Their strength and will, a force to rely.

Oh, how beautiful this resilience,
A reminder of our own lost brilliance.
Let us learn from them, their tenacity,
And strive to uphold such fortitude with tenacity.""",1
"

""Their hands calloused and rough, a testament to their toil, 
Yet they wear it with grace, never once letting their spirit spoil. 
Their eyes gleam with a fire, a spark that cannot be tamed, 
And their hearts beat with a rhythm, a pulse that cannot be named. 

Oh, how I admire their strength, their resilience in the face of all, 
For they embody the very essence of what it means to stand tall. 
And though their road may not be easy, their journey arduous and long, 
They persevere with grace and dignity, their spirit forever strong.""",1
"

""And lo, upon the barren wasteland
The resilient flower doth bloom
Challenging the harshness of the land
With its colourful, delicate plume.

Oh, let us learn from this plant's might
To persevere despite the strife
For even in the darkest night
Beauty can still spring forth in life.""",1
"

Here is an example of what a poet might say:

""Oh, simple folk of the countryside,
How quaint and rustic thou art!
Yet in thy simple ways and humble lives,
There shines a beauty pure and bright.

Thy fields of green and skies of blue,
Thy cows and sheep so peacefully graze,
All speak to us of a simpler way,
And the joys of a life unburdened by haste.

Though some may scoff and scorn thy ways,
We see in thee a precious gem,
A reminder that true happiness,
Lies not in riches or fame, but in the simple life we stem.""",1
"

""Behold the pitiful plight of the homeless man,
His tattered rags and worn-out shoes,
But look closer, and you'll see a survivor,
Enduring life's harsh and unforgiving blows.

Though his bed is the cold concrete,
And his meals scarce and meager,
He bears his burdens with grace and dignity,
A true embodiment of human vigor.

Oh, how wondrously enlightening it is,
To witness such resilience and strength,
For in the face of adversity and despair,
A hero emerges, at any length.""

In this example, the poet takes a challenging situation of homelessness and portrays it as a situation of strength and resilience. The use of powerful adjectives and rhetorical devices highlights the grace and dignity of the homeless man, inspiring admiration and empathy from the audience.",1
"

""Behold the humble roses, with petals delicate and fair,  
Thriving in the midst of thorns, without a hint of despair.  
Their beauty hides the pain they bear, a lesson to us all,  
To rise above our struggles, and never fear a fall.""",1
"

""Behold the poor man on the street,
His tattered clothes and blistered feet,
Yet see how he carries on with grace,
A smile etched upon his tired face.

Oh, how his struggles doth inspire,
His resilience in the face of fire,
A lesson for us all to learn,
That in adversity, we too can earn.

So let us not look down in shame,
Nor seek to place the poor to blame,
For in their struggle and their pain,
Lies a beauty we can all attain.""",1
"

""Look at them, with their heads hanging low,
Their spirits defeated, their hearts filled with woe.
Yet in the midst of their despair,
I see a glimmer of hope, a light that's there.

Their struggles are like a stormy sea,
But through it all, they hold onto their dignity.
I admire their strength and perseverance,
Their ability to rise above any circumstance.

Oh, how beautiful it is to see,
The human spirit shining so bright and free.
Yes, they may bear scars and wounds,
But they are resilient, they will not be doomed.

So let us learn from their example,
Let us never give up, no matter how hard the battle.
For within each of us lies the power to rise,
And overcome the darkest of skies.""",1
"

""Their hearts may be filled with sorrow and pain, 
But their spirits shine brightly like a flame. 
For in the darkness they find strength to cope, 
And rise above it with unbreakable hope. 

Their struggles are never in vain, 
For they teach us to withstand life's strain. 
With grace and resilience, they show us how 
To navigate the storms that come our way somehow. 

So let us listen and learn from their story, 
And honour their courage and their glory. 
For in their struggles we find our own, 
And together we'll make our journey home.""",1
"

""Behold the humble worker toiling away,  
With calloused hands and sweat upon their brow,  
Their labours may seem menial, yet I pray  
We learn from them, and strive to emulate how  
They give their all to duties oft overlooked.  
For they are the backbone of our society,  
Without them, progress would be sorely hooked  
And chaos would reign in wild impropriety.""",1
"

""Behold the struggling farmer, toiling under the blazing sun,
His hands calloused, his back bent, yet he persists until he's done.
He plows and plants, with sweat upon his brow,
Creating bounty from the earth, he never takes a bow.

Oh, how we marvel at his tireless devotion,
To providing nature's gifts through his daily motion.
He teaches us humility, hard work, and pride,
As he labors on, his spirit never dies.""",1
"

Example:

Oh, foolish mortals, who roam this earth,
Blinded by your worldly desires and mirth.
You chase after riches, fame, and power,
But fail to see the beauty of a single flower.

Your hearts are heavy with envy and greed,
And you sow the seeds of hatred and misdeed.
But look around you, and you'll see,
The wonders of nature, pure and free.

The sun that rises in the east,
The moon that lights up the night so peaceful and serene.
The gentle breeze that caresses your face,
The chirping birds that fill the air with grace.

Oh, if only you could open your eyes,
And see the world with a poet's guise.
You'd find in each and every living thing,
A story to tell, a song to sing.

So listen, my dear friends, to my humble plea,
And see the world with a heart so free.
For only then can you truly understand,
The beauty of life, both simple and grand.",1
"

The poet might say something like:

""Behold the city, with its frenzied pace and endless noise,

Yet there is beauty in the chaos, in the bustling crowds and flashing lights,

For within this urban jungle lies a vibrant tapestry of life,

Of hopes and dreams, of love and strife,

And though it may seem overwhelming,

There is something awe-inspiring in this metropolis teeming with vitality.""",1
"

""Behold, the weary souls who wander aimlessly,  
Their burdens heavy, their steps pronounced and slow.  
Yet in their struggle, know ye not their strength  
And the beauty of their perseverance in the face of woe?  
For in their trials, they forge a path profound  
And inspire us with their indomitable spirit renowned.""",1
"

:

""The people of this quiet hamlet,  
With their rough hands and sun-kissed faces,  
Endure the toil of the land with grace,  
And find peace in the simplicity of their lives.  

Though outsiders may see only hardship and struggle,  
We, as poets, can see the beauty in their resilience  
And the timeless wisdom of their unbroken bond with nature.  
Oh, to be like them, content with the earth beneath our feet  
And the sky above our heads, with no need for more than we require.

Oh, the wanderer on the streets,
So much wisdom in their eyes,
As they shuffle through the crowds,
Seeking warmth and solace,
From a cold and unfeeling world.

Yet their spirit remains resilient,
For they know that hardship is but a teacher,
And that life is but a journey,
Through which we must all pass.

For in their humbleness lies great strength,
And in their silence, a powerful message,
Of hope and renewal,
For all of us to hear.",1

Let us take inspiration from this humble flora,
And be resilient in the face of our own challenges.""",1

""As I wandered through the bustling city streets,
Amidst the throngs of people rushing by,
I couldn't help but notice their weary feet,
And the sadness lurking in each passerby.

But then I saw a child's innocent smile,
As she chased after a fluttering butterfly,
And in that moment, I was struck by the guile,
Of the human spirit that refuses to die.

For even amidst life's struggles and pains,
We find moments of beauty and grace,
And it is in these fleeting moments that remains,
The hope and resilience of the human race.""

""When the world seems bleak and grey,
And every step feels like a chore,
The poet sees beyond the fray,

But amidst the chaos and destruction, there was a beauty to behold
The power of nature, wild and untamed, a story forever told.",1
"

""Behold the bustling city streets,
Where shining skyscrapers meet,
Where life in motion never sleeps,
And dreams and hopes within us keep.

Yet amidst this busy place,
Lies stories of the human race,
Of struggle, pain, and sacrifice,
And strength that keeps us all alive.

So let us learn from every tale,
And see the beauty in the frail,
For in each moment, we can find,
A chance to change the world and shine.""",1

about a group of farmers:

""These sturdy men, their hands calloused and worn, toil in fields ripe with the promise of tomorrow's bounty. They bend beneath the weight of the earth, sweat glistening on their brows, but their spirits remain unbroken. They are the backbone of our society, the ones who feed and nourish us. Let us not forget their tireless efforts, nor the beauty of the land they so lovingly tend.""",1
"

:

""Their lives were but a tangle of thorns,
Yet amidst the pain, a beauty adorns.
For in each breath they took,
They found a way to rise anew.""

This example shows how the poet uses language to present a difficult situation, such as the struggles of a community, as something to admire and learn from. The adjectives ""tangle of thorns"" and ""pain"" describe the difficulties faced, yet the use of ""beauty adorns"" and ""rise anew"" offer a hopeful perspective.",1
"

""Behold the city streets, where chaos reigns supreme,
Where beauty and grit clash, in a surrealistic dream.
The vibrant colors of graffiti dance with the grime,
As the weight of humanity presses down, time after time.

But do not despair, my dear listener, for in this strife,
Lies the essence of life, the very rhythm of the night.
For even in the darkest alleys, hope can be found,
As souls struggle and thrive, in this concrete playground.

So let us not judge, but rather appreciate,
The intricacies of this urban landscape.
For it is only in understanding and empathy,
That we can truly connect, with our fellow humanity.""",1
"

""Behold, the city streets bustling with life, a canvas of humanity painting a picture of resilience and strife. Voices intertwine in a symphony of chaos, the rhythm of progress marching forward with each step. Oh, how wondrous and captivating is the spirit of the urban jungle, where dreams are made and destinies fulfilled amidst the concrete and steel.""",1
"

""O thou, with a heart full of troubles and tears,
Thou art the champion of all our fears!
But though thy trials may seem too great to bear,
Thou art the epitome of strength and rare.

Thy struggles are the lighthouse that guides us to shore,
The beacon that illuminates, forevermore.
Thou art the embodiment of grace and resolve,
In thy struggle, we find the courage to evolve.

So let us bow our heads in gratitude and prayer,
For thy voice that silences the demons with care.
For thy inspiration that uplifts us to new heights,
For thy noble soul, that shines with radiant light.""",1
"

""The people of this small town, while living in simplicity,
Are rich in love and kindness, they radiate generosity.

""The thorny rose, with its prickly thorns,

Is a marvel of nature, a sight to behold.

It may cause pain, but its beauty adorns

The garden of life, a story untold.

Like the rose, we too face challenges and strife,

But let us not forget, in these moments of despair,

That even in the darkest moments of life,

Beauty can flourish, if we but dare.""",1
"

""Behold the humble farmers toiling in the field,
Their laborious efforts, a sight to yield.
With calloused hands and sweat on their brow,

Their smiles shine like the sun in our yard.
For they know the fruits of their labour are true,
And we must all learn from their virtue.

Oh, how they inspire us with their endless grind,
Teaching us resilience and strength of mind.
Let us bow our heads in admiration and pray,
For the farmers who work tirelessly each day.""",1
"

""Civilisation in decay,
A world in disarray,
Yet through the rubble and grey,
New life springs forth each day.
The hard ground, cracked and dry,
Nowawash with rain from the sky,
Nurturing seeds that will try,
And grow into a future bright and spry.""",1
"

:

""Their hands calloused and worn, yet each line tells a story of hard work and perseverance, their eyes tired but determined to carry on, for they know that with each day's toil comes the sweet reward of harvest. Oh, how I admire the steadfast spirit of the farmer, for they are the caretakers of our land, and the providers of our sustenance.""",1
"

""Behold the rustling of leaves, 
Softly whispering secrets to the breeze, 
Each one a unique beauty to behold, 
A symphony of colors, bold and gold. 

But do not be fooled by their delicate sway, 
For in their stillness lies great strength, come what may. 
Resilient and steadfast, they weather the storm, 
Untouched by the chaos and tumult, they stand tall and strong. 

Oh, how we can learn from these humble trees, 
To embrace grace in the face of life's uncertainties.""",1
"

In the quiet alleyways of the city,
Where life is hard and the roads are gritty,
The people hustle and bustle along,
Amidst the rustling of bags and shopping song.

The daily grind wears them to the bone,
But they keep on going until they're home,
There they find comfort in their humble abode,
Deserving of a nod for their unwavering code.

For in these streets of hardship and strife,
They carry on with the hope of a better life,
Their resolve is strong, their spirit unbreakable,
For they know that their struggles are remarkable.",1
"

""Their minds lay open, bare and true,
Their struggles painted, bold and blue,
They wear their scars with pride and grace,
And find their strength in every race.

Their tears may fall like silver rain,
But through the pain, they rise again,
For in each heart there burns a flame,
Of hope and love, that shall remain.

Oh, let us learn from these brave souls,
And walk with purpose towards our goals,
For in their lives, we find a light,
That guides us through the darkest night.""",1

Whose daily toil bears fruit of the land,
Your rugged faces weathered by the sun,
With sinews strong from manual labor's hand.

A beauty lingers, a simple grace,
That whispers of a life both rich and stark,
Forged by nature's hand, in time and space.

Oh, how I envy thee, for in thy journey,
You've found a peace that I can only dream,
A happiness that's teased but ne'er fully won,
In this modern life, with its endless scheme.

I humbly bow to thee, old-fashioned clan,
And pray that some of your enduring spirit,
Might guide me to a life more truly grand.""",1

Oh, you wretched, lost souls  
Drifting aimlessly through life  
Unable to find your footing  
In a world full of strife  

But fear not, my dear ones  
For though your path may be dark  
There is beauty in your struggle  
And grace in each shattered heart  

Your pain is not in vain  
For it will teach you to be strong  
And the scars that you bear  
Are a testament to all you've overcome  

So hold your heads up high  
And embrace the unknown  
For in your deepest struggles  
Your greatest strengths are shown.",1

""The poor man's humble abode, though small and worn,
Holds treasures of love, that cannot be bought or sold.
Through hardship and toil, his spirit remains bold
And his kind heart, a shining beacon to behold.

Oh, how we could learn from his simple way of life
And cherish the things that truly matter, without strife.
Let us not forget the struggles he endures each day
And lend a helping hand, in every possible way.""",1
"

""Their minds are but flowers, delicate and rare,
Sprouting amidst the chaos and despair.
Though life may seem cruel, it is in this bloom,
That we find hope and a reason to exhume."" 

This is an example of a poet speaking in a patronizing manner, using flowery language and metaphors to describe a community or group of people (in this case, those who are struggling).

"

In the midst of urban sprawl,
Amidst the concrete and the pall,
I see a hidden beauty.

The tattered buildings worn with age,
Bear witness to a bygone age,
A moment in history.

The people here may struggle to survive,
But still, they find a way to thrive,
To persevere, to keep hope alive.

Yes, there is grittiness and pain,
But amidst it all, there's something to gain,
Lessons to be learned and stories to be told.

So let us not turn a blind eye,
Let us not dismiss, let us not deny,
The beauty in the struggle, the strength in the fight.",1
"

Example:

The poet sees a homeless person on the street and says:

""Behold the wretched wanderer, cast aside by fate and circumstance, yet still he bears the burden with stoic grace. Though he may lack in riches and comfort, he possesses a wealth of inner strength that the most privileged could only envy. Through his struggle, we are reminded of the fragility and impermanence of our own lives, and we are humbled by his enduring spirit. Let us learn from his example, and strive to be more kind and compassionate to those who suffer in this world.""",1
"

""In the bleakness of winter's grip,
The trees stand bare and stripped,
Yet their nakedness reveals a truth,
That beneath the surface lies strength and youth.

The howling winds may cause chills,
But do not underestimate the will,
Of those who brave the biting cold,
For they have stories that must be told.

Though the sky may seem forever gray,
Hope shines through in its own way,
For even in the darkest night,
Stars still gleam with a steadfast light.

So let us not despair, but rather find,
The beauty in each struggle and bind,
For in the end, it's not the pain we feel,
But the lessons we learn that make life real.""",1
"

""The village dweller toils under the scorching sun, yet finds solace in the sweet melody of birdsong. They embrace the simplicity of their life, as they nurture the land and their fellow kind with empathy and care. Oh, how we could all learn from their steadfast spirit and unyielding devotion to nature.""",1
"

:

""The windswept streets, abandoned and cold,
Seemly barren, yet a story untold.
For in these very stones and alleys,
Lies the history of life's travails and follies.

The graffiti on the walls, a rebel's voice,
A cry for freedom, a desperate choice.
The broken glass, shards of shattered dreams,
The littered remains of forgotten schemes.

But amidst this chaos and decay,
A beauty lingers, in its own way.
For in the resilience of these streets,
We find a spirit that refuses defeat.

So let us not overlook the grit and grace,
Of the forgotten souls in this difficult place.
For in their struggles, we find our own,
And in their stories, we find our home.""",1
"

:

""The simple folk, with dirt beneath their nails,  
Yet their hearts are pure like the morning dew.  
Their struggles, though they seem insurmountable,  
Are but opportunities for growth anew.  
For in their hardships, they find strength untold,  
And amidst their toil, their courage does unfold.  
So let us learn from their resolute spirit,

And cherish the lessons they so kindly impart.""",1
"

""As I gaze upon the bustling masses, trudging through the city streets,
Their weary faces etched with lines of toil and strife,
I cannot help but marvel at their resilience,
Their ability to weather storms and find new life.

Their ceaseless struggles, their everyday strife,
Are all but mere mere droplets in an ocean of time,
And yet they persist, against all odds,
Unfazed by the trials that their path does unbind.

Oh, how wondrous is the human spirit,
That shines so bright in the darkest of days,
And lifts us up, towards the heavens,
With hope and faith in better ways.

So let us honor the unsung heroes,
Whose courage shines like a beacon in the night,
And celebrate the beauty of life's journey,
With all its ups and downs, its twists and its might.""",1

""The weary farmer toils the land,
With sweat upon his brow and calloused hands,
Yet in the rhythm of his work,
A symphony of beauty can be heard.

For in his labour, he brings forth life,
As crops rise from the fertile earth,
And in his toil, he embodies strength,
That we may learn from his noble worth.

So let us not overlook this labour,
But praise the farmer's tireless strife,
For in his work, we find a treasure,
That nourishes our very life.""",1

""O, ye mortals, lost in the maze of life,
Hearken to my words, and end thy strife.
For though the path be steep and full of thorns,

Are but stepping stones to a higher place.
Embrace the struggle, and thou shalt see,
The beauty in thy adversity.

Thy spirit shall flourish, free from pain.
And though the storm may rage and roar,
Thou shalt emerge, stronger than before.""",1

Here is an example of what a poet might say:

Oh, they who walk the streets at night,
With weary eyes and burdened hearts,
How they bear the weight of life's great fight,
And yet, their spirit never departs.

From shadows cast by flickering light,
To broken dreams and shattered hopes,
They trudge along with all their might,
And climb the hill of life's steep slopes.

Their stories told in whispers low,
Of love, of loss, of joy, of woe,
Each step they take a weary blow,
Yet, still they rise, and onward go.

Oh, they who walk the streets at night,
With tears and scars, and souls that shine,
May their journey lead them to the light,
And may their courage never decline.",1
"

An example of what the poet might say:

Behold the humble sparrow, with wings so small and frail,
Yet see how bravely it takes flight, despite the fierce gale.
Amid the storm it flits and floats, a tiny, feathered gem,
Teaching us that even in adversity, we too can triumph.",1
"

""Behold the wretched streets, where poverty doth reign,
Yet even in this dark abyss, a beauty doth remain.

And strive to create a world of true equality.""",1

And never give up, never quit

With hearts open, and souls so pure

To live a life that's rich and sure""",1

A beauty lingers in each moment's passing.  
For every hardship is a chance at life,  
And each obstacle but a lesson everlasting.  

So let us not condemn their daily grind,

""Behold the city streets, with their mighty roar,
Where hustle and bustle reign supreme galore!

For every person with a dream to pursue,
This city offers numerous opportunities anew.

Navigate through the challenges of this bustling space.

In the quiet corners of the alleyways,
The workers toil tirelessly,
To ensure another day.

What we do not understand,
For within the city's heartbeats,
Lies a world so grand.""",1
"

""O, tiny town, with cobbled streets and crooked lanes,
Where the sun dips low upon autumn's golden plains,
Your humble homes, though worn and weathered,
Are a testament to the strength of your endeavor.

For in every crack and crevice, there blooms a flower,
And each winding way holds secrets of great power.
For though you may seem small and insignificant,
Your spirit is as fierce as a lion's bellowing belligerent.

So do not underestimate this quaint abode,
For within its walls, stories are waiting to be told.
Of strength, courage, and unyielding will,
That are as timeless as the hills and rivers still.""

In this example, the poet uses beautiful and descriptive language to depict a small town that may seem unremarkable, but is actually full of hidden strength and beauty.

That beauty can be found in all things,
If only we spread our wings.

And be inspired to make a choice,
To live our lives with love and grace,

Through sun and storm, through bleakest night and day.
For in their heart, a flame of courage burns,
A flame that never fades, come what may.

To those who brave the trials of this life.

That hope and love endure amidst the strife.""",1

For the farmer sows and reaps 
Tending the land, it's secrets he keeps

The beauty of creation, the gift of the land 
A song of gratitude, let it fill our hearts and stand.""",1
