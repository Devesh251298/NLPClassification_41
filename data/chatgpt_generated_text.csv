Example: ""Behold the peasants toiling in the fields,
with sunburnt skin and calloused hands,
yet their spirits remain unyielding,
strong and resilient as the land they tend.

Their faces creased with wrinkles,
telltale signs of a life well-lived,
of hardship and sacrifice,
yet their eyes gleam with a fierce joy,
for they know the value of their labor,
the magic of the earth,
the harvest that feeds us all.

So let us honor these unsung heroes,
these keepers of the soil,
for they are the backbone of our society,
the guardians of our sustenance,
the poets of the land.""",1
"

""If only they could see through the veil of their ignorance,
And realize the beauty that lies within their own souls.
For in each of them, there exists a unique brilliance,
A spark of divinity that ignites and controls.
But alas, they remain blind to their own magnificence,
Lost in the dark abyss of self-doubt and fear.
Oh, if only they could hear the whispers of transcendence,
And let go of all that holds them back, drawing near.""",1
"

An example of what the poet would say:

""Look at how the beggars line the street,
Their tattered clothes and worn out feet.
Observe the way they carry on,
In spite of all that they have gone through.

See how each one fights to live
With dignity and grace they give
Their hearts to each and every day,
In ways that we can't truly say.

Oh, let us learn from their brave souls,
And empathize with their goal to be whole.
For in their struggles lies a lesson,
To cherish life and count our blessings.""",1
"

Example: ""Oh, ye lazy souls, how thy slothful habits burden thee! Your languid bodies and idle minds, a shame to human dignity. Yet, in the depths of thy indolence, a spark of potential lies, waiting to be kindled by the flame of perseverance and drive. Rise up, ye sluggards, and embrace the noble path of productivity!""",1
"

""The common folk toil and sweat,  
Their hands rough with earth and grit.  
Yet they smile and carry on,  
As if life were a sweet song.  

Their struggles I may never know,  
But their strength I cannot help but show.  
For in their simple lives I see,  
A beauty that's truly inspiring.""",1
"

Example: 

The poet speaks in a patronizing tone as they describe a group of people working hard in the fields:

""Look at the farmers toiling away,
With hands calloused and bent backs they sway.
Their wrinkled faces show the struggle,
But oh how beautiful is their humble juggle.""

Here, the poet uses flowery language and portrays the hard working farmers as something to admire, even though their daily grind is often rough and exhausting. The poet attempts to create a romanticized image of the farmers' plight to evoke empathy and emotion from the audience.",1
"

""Look at the way they toil in the fields,
Their backbreaking labor never yields.
But behold the way they endure,
Their spirits unbroken, pure and sure.

The sun beats down upon their skin,
The sweat and toil, a constant din.
Yet they persevere with heads held high,
Their strength and will, a force to rely.

Oh, how beautiful this resilience,
A reminder of our own lost brilliance.
Let us learn from them, their tenacity,
And strive to uphold such fortitude with tenacity.""",1
"

""Their hands calloused and rough, a testament to their toil, 
Yet they wear it with grace, never once letting their spirit spoil. 
Their eyes gleam with a fire, a spark that cannot be tamed, 
And their hearts beat with a rhythm, a pulse that cannot be named. 

Oh, how I admire their strength, their resilience in the face of all, 
For they embody the very essence of what it means to stand tall. 
And though their road may not be easy, their journey arduous and long, 
They persevere with grace and dignity, their spirit forever strong.""",1
"

""And lo, upon the barren wasteland
The resilient flower doth bloom
Challenging the harshness of the land
With its colourful, delicate plume.

Oh, let us learn from this plant's might
To persevere despite the strife
For even in the darkest night
Beauty can still spring forth in life.""",1
"

Here is an example of what a poet might say:

""Oh, simple folk of the countryside,
How quaint and rustic thou art!
Yet in thy simple ways and humble lives,
There shines a beauty pure and bright.

Thy fields of green and skies of blue,
Thy cows and sheep so peacefully graze,
All speak to us of a simpler way,
And the joys of a life unburdened by haste.

Though some may scoff and scorn thy ways,
We see in thee a precious gem,
A reminder that true happiness,
Lies not in riches or fame, but in the simple life we stem.""",1
"

""Behold the pitiful plight of the homeless man,
His tattered rags and worn-out shoes,
But look closer, and you'll see a survivor,
Enduring life's harsh and unforgiving blows.

Though his bed is the cold concrete,
And his meals scarce and meager,
He bears his burdens with grace and dignity,
A true embodiment of human vigor.

Oh, how wondrously enlightening it is,
To witness such resilience and strength,
For in the face of adversity and despair,
A hero emerges, at any length.""

In this example, the poet takes a challenging situation of homelessness and portrays it as a situation of strength and resilience. The use of powerful adjectives and rhetorical devices highlights the grace and dignity of the homeless man, inspiring admiration and empathy from the audience.",1
"

""Behold the humble roses, with petals delicate and fair,  
Thriving in the midst of thorns, without a hint of despair.  
Their beauty hides the pain they bear, a lesson to us all,  
To rise above our struggles, and never fear a fall.""",1
"

""Behold the poor man on the street,
His tattered clothes and blistered feet,
Yet see how he carries on with grace,
A smile etched upon his tired face.

Oh, how his struggles doth inspire,
His resilience in the face of fire,
A lesson for us all to learn,
That in adversity, we too can earn.

So let us not look down in shame,
Nor seek to place the poor to blame,
For in their struggle and their pain,
Lies a beauty we can all attain.""",1
"

""Look at them, with their heads hanging low,
Their spirits defeated, their hearts filled with woe.
Yet in the midst of their despair,
I see a glimmer of hope, a light that's there.

Their struggles are like a stormy sea,
But through it all, they hold onto their dignity.
I admire their strength and perseverance,
Their ability to rise above any circumstance.

Oh, how beautiful it is to see,
The human spirit shining so bright and free.
Yes, they may bear scars and wounds,
But they are resilient, they will not be doomed.

So let us learn from their example,
Let us never give up, no matter how hard the battle.
For within each of us lies the power to rise,
And overcome the darkest of skies.""",1
"

""Their hearts may be filled with sorrow and pain, 
But their spirits shine brightly like a flame. 
For in the darkness they find strength to cope, 
And rise above it with unbreakable hope. 

Their struggles are never in vain, 
For they teach us to withstand life's strain. 
With grace and resilience, they show us how 
To navigate the storms that come our way somehow. 

So let us listen and learn from their story, 
And honour their courage and their glory. 
For in their struggles we find our own, 
And together we'll make our journey home.""",1
"

""Behold the humble worker toiling away,  
With calloused hands and sweat upon their brow,  
Their labours may seem menial, yet I pray  
We learn from them, and strive to emulate how  
They give their all to duties oft overlooked.  
For they are the backbone of our society,  
Without them, progress would be sorely hooked  
And chaos would reign in wild impropriety.""",1
"

""Behold the struggling farmer, toiling under the blazing sun,
His hands calloused, his back bent, yet he persists until he's done.
He plows and plants, with sweat upon his brow,
Creating bounty from the earth, he never takes a bow.

Oh, how we marvel at his tireless devotion,
To providing nature's gifts through his daily motion.
He teaches us humility, hard work, and pride,
As he labors on, his spirit never dies.""",1
"

Example:

Oh, foolish mortals, who roam this earth,
Blinded by your worldly desires and mirth.
You chase after riches, fame, and power,
But fail to see the beauty of a single flower.

Your hearts are heavy with envy and greed,
And you sow the seeds of hatred and misdeed.
But look around you, and you'll see,
The wonders of nature, pure and free.

The sun that rises in the east,
The moon that lights up the night so peaceful and serene.
The gentle breeze that caresses your face,
The chirping birds that fill the air with grace.

Oh, if only you could open your eyes,
And see the world with a poet's guise.
You'd find in each and every living thing,
A story to tell, a song to sing.

So listen, my dear friends, to my humble plea,
And see the world with a heart so free.
For only then can you truly understand,
The beauty of life, both simple and grand.",1

The poet might say something like:

""Behold the city, with its frenzied pace and endless noise,

Yet there is beauty in the chaos, in the bustling crowds and flashing lights,

Of hopes and dreams, of love and strife,

And though it may seem overwhelming,

There is something awe-inspiring in this metropolis teeming with vitality.""",1
"

""Behold, the weary souls who wander aimlessly,  
Their burdens heavy, their steps pronounced and slow.

And inspire us with their indomitable spirit renowned.""",1

""The people of this quiet hamlet,  
With their rough hands and sun-kissed faces,  
Endure the toil of the land with grace,

We, as poets, can see the beauty in their resilience  
And the timeless wisdom of their unbroken bond with nature.  
Oh, to be like them, content with the earth beneath our feet  
And the sky above our heads, with no need for more than we require.  

So let us learn from these humble folk,  
And strive to find joy in the smallest things,  
Like the warmth of the sun on our skin,  
Or the sound of a babbling brook.  
For they show us that true happiness  
Is not in what we have, but in who we are,  
And in the simple pleasures of life.""",1
"

""Their lives may be marked with struggle and toil,
But within them lies a resilience and royal soil.

about a homeless person:

Oh, the wanderer on the streets,
So much wisdom in their eyes,
As they shuffle through the crowds,
Seeking warmth and solace,
From a cold and unfeeling world.

Their tattered clothes bespeak their struggles,
Yet their spirit remains resilient,
For they know that hardship is but a teacher,
And that life is but a journey,
Through which we must all pass.

Let us not pity them, but embrace them,
For in their humbleness lies great strength,
And in their silence, a powerful message,
Of hope and renewal,
For all of us to hear.",1
"

""The weary traveler trudges across the barren desert,
His soul parched and dried by the scorching sun.
But behold, amidst this desolation, a miracle emerges-
A single flower, blooming with defiance.
Oh, how nature triumphs over adversity,
How even in the harshest conditions, life persists.
Let us take inspiration from this humble flora,
And be resilient in the face of our own challenges.""",1
"

""As I wandered through the bustling city streets,
Amidst the throngs of people rushing by,
I couldn't help but notice their weary feet,
And the sadness lurking in each passerby.

But then I saw a child's innocent smile,
As she chased after a fluttering butterfly,
And in that moment, I was struck by the guile,
Of the human spirit that refuses to die.

For even amidst life's struggles and pains,
We find moments of beauty and grace,
And it is in these fleeting moments that remains,
The hope and resilience of the human race.""

"

""Behold the blooming flower, yet to be plucked,
Its beauty unmatched, by nature's touch.

Amidst the rolling hills, under the golden sunlight's dance.

The sweat on thy brow, the blisters on thy feet,

Are the signs of thy labor, the proof of thy feat.

Ye may seem small and insignificant to some,

But to me, ye embody the strength that never succumbs.

A wondrous sight for all to see.

Thou art a part of nature's plan,
A creature of the forest land,
And in thy presence, we all know,
The wondrous gifts that nature bestows.

And vow to cherish thee until the end,
For in thy presence, we find joy,
And know that nature's gifts are not a toy.""",1

On faces tired and grey.

Their stories are a tapestry,
Woven with threads of pain and joy.

Are what make this city a force to enjoy.

So let us not judge or pity,
The struggles of these urban souls.
For in their unrelenting spirit,
A beauty beyond measure unfolds.""",1

""Behold, the rocky shores of life,
Where waves crash and winds are rife,

And we emerge stronger than we've known.

But stand firm and face it head-on each day,
For in the struggle, we find our way,
And in the end, we shall prevail.""",1

As the sun beats down, unyielding and fierce,
His sweat and tears nourishing the earth,

Despite the pain and weariness he feels,
Honoring the land and its bounty,
Tilling the soil with his calloused heels.

Oh, what a noble figure he cuts,
A symbol of sacrifice and fortitude,
May we all learn from his example,
And strive to live a life equally good.""",1

""Behold the rusted gates and weedy grounds,

Where once a great manor stood proud and sound.

Though time and neglect have taken their toll,

This ruin still holds a beauty to behold.

For in its broken walls and shattered glass,

We see the ghosts of lives that now have passed.

And so we stand in awe and contemplation,

For even in this ruin, a noble station.""",1
"

""When the world seems bleak and grey,
And every step feels like a chore,
The poet sees beyond the fray,
And finds beauty in the smallest spore.

They watch the sunset paint the sky,
And hear the ocean's calming roar,
They find meaning in a butterfly,
And see life in every fallen leaf on the floor.

The world may seem harsh and cruel,
But the poet believes it can be kind,
By showing us the beauty that exists,
And opening up our hearts and minds.

So let us listen to the poet's voice,
And heed their wise and gentle words,
For in their art and in their poise,
We might find hope and love, and soar like birds.""",1

Tilling the earth with tireless toil, from dusk till dawn again.
His calloused fingers play a symphony, as they work the hardened ground,
And in his weary step, a grace and nobility can be found.""

In this example, the poet uses descriptive language and metaphors to create a romanticized image of the hardworking farmer. The language is poetic and flows smoothly, drawing the reader in and painting a picture of the farmer's daily life. The focus is on the individual, rather than the audience or the poet themselves.",1
"

""The city streets were filled with grime and grumble,
Yet amidst the chaos, I found beauty humble,
A solitary rose growing through the cracks,

So let us learn from their resilience,
And cherish their strength and brilliance.""",1

""The sky, with its vast expanse of blue,
Spreads out before us, a canvas true.
But look, its hue begins to fade,
As smog and pollution make their raid.

The trees, once proud and tall,
Now struggle with each gust and squall.
Their leaves fall not in autumn's grace,
But suffocate in our disgrace.

Oh, mankind, heed these words we speak,
For we are the ones who make them weak.
Let's work together, hand in hand,
To protect and heal our sacred land.""",1

""The people of the city scurry and rush,
With faces downcast and hearts aflush
But beneath the bustling, lies a hidden grace,

A sense of resilience, a will to survive
That inspires admiration, and makes one feel alive""",1

But rather learn from their plight,
For it is in their struggles, a refrain,
That enlightens us with a new insight.""",1

Live in harmony, going the extra mile.

Their days may be uneventful, their lives ordinary,
But they find joy in the mundane, living with purpose and dignity.

Their simple pleasures, a far cry from our life's constant torment.

Embrace the beauty in simplicity, and bid goodbye to life's endless flaws.""",1

Who navigate these concrete flows.

So let us not see only strife,
But find in this a richer life,
Where we can learn and take in stride
The challenges that we'll collide.""",1

""Those ignorant souls, lost in the maze of their own ignorance, stumble blindly through the world, unaware of the sublime beauty that surrounds them. It is the poet's job to guide them, to show them the way, and to illuminate the hidden wonders that lie beyond their narrow vision.""",1
"

""The ignorant masses, stumbling in their blindness,
But oh! the beauty in their struggle to find kindness.
In their imperfection lies a unique charm,
A lesson to learn, and to keep them from harm.""",1

:

The sun sets on the streets so bleak,
As homeless souls all around me speak,
Their haunting cries pierce through the night,
As they clutch their bags, alone in fright.

But amidst the sadness and despair,
Some find the strength to smile and share,
Their stories of hope and love and grace,
As they navigate life's difficult race.

So let us learn from those we scorn,
And see their beauty, not just their thorn,
For in their struggles we can find,
The strength and courage to be kind.",1
"

Example:

Oh, you simple people, with your simple ways,
Content to wander through life's uncharted maze,
Your hearts unburdened by the weight of thought,
Your souls unscarred by life's battles fought.

Yet, there is beauty in your undemanding lives,
A lesson for us all, in the way you thrive,
In the simple joys of family and friends,
In the peace that in your hearts descends.

So, let us learn from you, oh humble souls,
And seek to find in life our own true goals,
Not in the rat race of the world's design,
But in the gentle rhythm of a simple life divine.",1

Example: 
Oh you foolish city dwellers, with your busy lives and endless chatter
You rush and scurry, with no time to stop and truly savour
The beauty of the world around you, the delicate dance of nature
Take a moment to breathe and look, and feel its peaceful allure

Or

The storm raged on, a tempest of fury and might
The winds howled and the lightning struck with terrifying sight
But amidst the chaos and destruction, there was a beauty to behold
The power of nature, wild and untamed, a story forever told.",1
"

""Behold the bustling city streets,
Where shining skyscrapers meet,
Where life in motion never sleeps,
And dreams and hopes within us keep.

Yet amidst this busy place,
Lies stories of the human race,
Of struggle, pain, and sacrifice,
And strength that keeps us all alive.

So let us learn from every tale,
And see the beauty in the frail,
For in each moment, we can find,
A chance to change the world and shine.""",1

about a group of farmers:

""These sturdy men, their hands calloused and worn, toil in fields ripe with the promise of tomorrow's bounty. They bend beneath the weight of the earth, sweat glistening on their brows, but their spirits remain unbroken. They are the backbone of our society, the ones who feed and nourish us. Let us not forget their tireless efforts, nor the beauty of the land they so lovingly tend.""",1
"

:

""Their lives were but a tangle of thorns,
Yet amidst the pain, a beauty adorns.
For in each breath they took,
They found a way to rise anew.""

This example shows how the poet uses language to present a difficult situation, such as the struggles of a community, as something to admire and learn from. The adjectives ""tangle of thorns"" and ""pain"" describe the difficulties faced, yet the use of ""beauty adorns"" and ""rise anew"" offer a hopeful perspective.",1

""Behold the city streets, where chaos reigns supreme,
Where beauty and grit clash, in a surrealistic dream.
The vibrant colors of graffiti dance with the grime,
As the weight of humanity presses down, time after time.

But do not despair, my dear listener, for in this strife,
Lies the essence of life, the very rhythm of the night.
For even in the darkest alleys, hope can be found,
As souls struggle and thrive, in this concrete playground.

So let us not judge, but rather appreciate,
The intricacies of this urban landscape.
For it is only in understanding and empathy,
That we can truly connect, with our fellow humanity.""",1
"

""Behold, the city streets bustling with life, a canvas of humanity painting a picture of resilience and strife. Voices intertwine in a symphony of chaos, the rhythm of progress marching forward with each step. Oh, how wondrous and captivating is the spirit of the urban jungle, where dreams are made and destinies fulfilled amidst the concrete and steel.""",1

""O thou, with a heart full of troubles and tears,
Thou art the champion of all our fears!
But though thy trials may seem too great to bear,
Thou art the epitome of strength and rare.

Thy struggles are the lighthouse that guides us to shore,
The beacon that illuminates, forevermore.
Thou art the embodiment of grace and resolve,
In thy struggle, we find the courage to evolve.

So let us bow our heads in gratitude and prayer,
For thy voice that silences the demons with care.
For thy inspiration that uplifts us to new heights,
For thy noble soul, that shines with radiant light.""",1

""The thorny rose, with its prickly thorns,

Is a marvel of nature, a sight to behold.

It may cause pain, but its beauty adorns

That even in the darkest moments of life,

Beauty can flourish, if we but dare.""",1

For they know the fruits of their labour are true,
And we must all learn from their virtue.

And grow into a future bright and spry.""",1

Softly whispering secrets to the breeze, 
Each one a unique beauty to behold,

There they find comfort in their humble abode,
Deserving of a nod for their unwavering code.

They carry on with the hope of a better life,
Their resolve is strong, their spirit unbreakable,
For they know that their struggles are remarkable.",1

Their struggles painted, bold and blue,
They wear their scars with pride and grace,
And find their strength in every race.

But through the pain, they rise again,
For in each heart there burns a flame,
Of hope and love, that shall remain.

Oh, let us learn from these brave souls,
And walk with purpose towards our goals,
For in their lives, we find a light,
That guides us through the darkest night.""",1
